There's nothing quite like a milkshake when that's what you're craving, and they feel so nostalgic and old-fashioned. Creamy, frothy, sweet, and icy cold, milkshakes can cool you off on a hot and humid day or satisfy an ice-cream urge in a unique way. This recipe is extra sweet, as it calls for fresh strawberries, but you can use frozen ones if that's all you have.


While itâ€™s not necessary to soak the strawberries in sugar before blending, it's an extra step that makes a difference. That little bit of sugar (just a tablespoon) pulls out the natural juices and intensifies the sweetness in a way that gives your milkshake amazing flavor. Letting the strawberries sit in the sugar before blending macerates and softens them, and it really does the trick. Sometimes the sweetness of fresh berries can vary, and using a little bit of sugar amplifies the natural sweetness. If you really, truly love strawberries, use strawberry ice cream instead of vanilla.
